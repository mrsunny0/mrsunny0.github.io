          I had the honor of attending UC Berkeley, an amazing instution where I gained a passion for academic rigor and scientific discoveries. I received a B.S. in Bioengineering along with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2014. I studied under Professor David V. Schaffer (<a href="http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/schaffer/">Scahffer Lab</a>) and Mikhail Shapiro (<a href="http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/">Shapiro Lab</a>). While there I received the <a href="https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/regents-and-chancellors-scholarship">Regents & Chancellor's Scholarship</a>, Leadership Award, the <a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/training/IMSD">IMSD NIH Research Fellowship</a> and proudly led the Campus Residential Tutoring Services for Chemistry. I had an incredible experience, and an opportunity of a lifetime.

            popup: >
              My advisors at Berkeley greatly influenced my passion for the biological and engineering sciences. I began my PhD career in 2014 with advisor Angela Belcher (<a href="http://belcherlab.mit.edu/">Belcher Lab</a>). My research was at the intersection of synthetic biology and biomaterials, focusing on sustainable solutions for removing and remediating heavy metals. Several of my publications can be found at 
              <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e49qUnMAAAAJ&hl=en">Nature Publication</a>,
              and several personal projects will be published on bioRxiv. While at MIT I was awarded the Presidential Fellowship, the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the Bose Fellowship, and several other research-based grants.

              My thesis titled <i>Engineering Yeast for Heavy Metal Waste Remediation</i>, contains work related to methods, strategies, and inventions on engineering yeast (the common Baker's yeast) as a vehicle to sequester, consume, and recycle heavy metals from waste environments. Those interested can read my <a href="https://mrsunny0.github.io/phd-thesis/">dissertation</a>, defended on June 6th, 2019. The study required an interdisciplinary combination of synthetic biology, protein engineering, and material science which caters itself to a broad range of scientific audiences and enthusiasts.

              I led their embedded design and electronics group, in hopes of creating a new wave of intelligent footwear. I was exposed to new design thinking and a unique creative energy that comes from a merge of an academic institution and a world leading consumer brand. These insights have shaped how I view problems from both an engineering and aesthetic perspective to this day.

          <a href="http://mithackingarts.com/">Hacking Arts</a>, 
          and finally my favorite &mdash; hardware-based hackathons, some of which were sponsored by Intel and other companies which released upcoming tools and hardware before being released to the public.

            What teaching has taught me is that knowledge should be shared freely, and that collections of knowledge benefit greatly from input from a variety of sources. Therefore, materials (much like this website) are publically available via open repositories like Github. This movement is not new, so while at the Communication Lab we adopted formats such as the

The culmination of our work were the annual Student Innovation Challenge. While as a judge, it was one of the few experiences where I saw what it was like to be behind the judging table. It was extremely difficult to qualify a variety of variables, such as the difficulty of the project, how the student conveyed a compelling narrative, and how impactful their solution may be.
